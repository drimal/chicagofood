ChicagoFood
===================

In this project, I am building a predictive model to predict the critical food safety vilations by the restaurants in the city of Chicago.For this, I used last 2.5 years of Chicago's food inspection data along with the other open data sources including crimes in the neighborhood and nearby reports of sanitation complaints.

Dataset and Features
=====================
We used city of Chicago's Socrata Open Data (SODA) API to access food inspection data spanning 2017-01-01 to 2019-07-01. In addition to the food inspection data, we are using burglary/crime, 311 sanitation complaints, weather, business license data over the same time period. Dataset to be used:

1. Food Inspection
2. 311 sanitation Complaints
3. Burglaries from crime data
4. Weather (5 day moving average of daily maximums)
5. Business license
6. Yelp business ratings
