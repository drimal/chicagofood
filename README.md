ChicagoFood
==============================

In this project, I am building a model to predict a binary classification model for the restaurant inspections in the city of Chicago. For this, I used last 2 years of food inspection data along with the other data sources incluidng crimes in the neighborhood and nearby reports of sanitation complaints.
